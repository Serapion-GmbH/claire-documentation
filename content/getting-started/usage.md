The app provides detailed insights into your monthly consumption, allowing you to track usage both in tokens and dollars. It also includes filtering options to monitor specific bots.

### 1. Monthly Token Consumption

You can view your monthly token consumption to monitor how much processing power is being utilized by your bots. This is particularly useful to ensure that you're optimizing resources effectively.

### 3. Filtering by Bots

The app allows you to filter data by specific bots, providing a more granular view of each bot's performance and usage. This is particularly helpful if you manage multiple bots and need to assess individual activity.
